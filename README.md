# MRM-BERT

The code is the implementation of our method described in the paper “Ying Zhang, Fang Ge, Fuyi Li, Xibei Yang, Jiangning Song, and Dong-Jun Yu, Prediction of Multiple Types of RNA Modifications via Biological Language Model”.

## (1) Environment setup:
Refer to https://github.com/jerryji1993/DNABERT#readme.

## (2) Download the well-trained models of our method:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13AG0ByRp_WKj8vg8r0Xj94vFjaoeGIJR

## (3) For multi-sequence prediction:
code/main_Multi_prediction.py

## (4) For single-sequence prediction and analysis
code/main_Single_att_analyse.py

## (5) Fine-tune with pre-trained model
Refer to DNABERT, and pay attention to preprocessing the sequences into k-mer format.
